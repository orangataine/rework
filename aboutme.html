                A little bit about what I do.
            </h1>
            <p1>
                In mid 2020, I wanted to find a new challenge and experience as a creative. I've done music,
                tried being a designer, majored as an art director, the list goes on. I like to surround myself 
                with things that inspire me. Clothing has been one of those things that I've taken somewhat seriously
                for some time now. Picking outfits and choosing colours that bond well together, noticing the way 
                a shirt should be a couple centimeters shorter, the way the sleeves fall on my arms. It sort of 
                came naturally, but I wasn't always like this. Like every other kid in the mid 2000's, I stuck to 
                bulky DC skate shoes, 3 quater zip pants, fake snapbacks and black skinny jeans, I went through phases as we all do.
                Clothing is a way to express yourself. There's nothing better than feeling confident
                in a fresh outfit. RE: WORK was an idea that sprung to mind because I was noticing the struggle of finding
                fabric that was good quality and affordable. For this reason I decided I'd start to thrift, rework pieces of clothing
                and give them some new life and personality. Enjoy.
